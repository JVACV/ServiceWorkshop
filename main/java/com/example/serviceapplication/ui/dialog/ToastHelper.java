 * <p>
 * A toast is a view containing a quick little message for the user. The toast class helps you create and show those.
 * When the view is shown to the user, appears as a floating view over the application.
 * It will never receive focus. The user will probably be in the middle of typing something else.
 * The idea is to be as unobtrusive as possible, while still showing the user the information you want them to see.
 * Two examples are the volume control, and the brief message saying that your settings have been saved.
